## Project Description
Your project description here.
The goal of this project is to identify the bank credit card users most likely churn. The Project 
will include a Python package for a machine learning that predicts whether the credit card users 
of a bank will churn or not. Best software and engineering practices for PEP8 such as clean 
and modular code, documentation, logging and test driven development will be employed to  produce 
a production code.It involves
- Loading data
- Preparing the data
- Exploring the data to understand it
- Feature engineering
- Building model
- Evaluating model
- Storing models, images, results and logs
